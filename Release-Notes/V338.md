| Enhancement |	Description | Endpoint | Links to article(s) in Knowledge Base

| Restart Failed Users as part of the Environment Scan | If the Environment Scan shows Failed Users, you can press the Retry Failed Users button to run the scan for failed users only, instead of the entire scan again. This allows you to restart at the point where the Environment Scan failed or stopped. | Google and Microsoft | 	<a href="https://cloudm-migrate.github.io/documentation/Migration-Project-Guides/O365.html#scanning-the-source-environment-endpoint">Environment Scan</a>

Teams to Teams Private Chat rehydration | When carrying out a Microsoft 365 to Microsoft 365 migration, there is a new configuration option allowing for Teams private chat messages between users to be rehydrated so that they are available to view via the destination Teams client. Migrate previously supported migrating these messages into a specific folder within the users mailbox. With the addition of this new feature, the last 10 messages will be migrated into a Teams chat in the destination, as well as into the users mail folder. By allowing users to easily access their last messages within Teams the end user experience is improved. Additionally, within the migrated messages, the users will also be informed that the remainder of the messages are available in the relevant folder within their mailbox. This will allow users to find and access older messages more quickly and easily, and ultimately make supporting users post migration simpler. | Microsoft | <a href="https://cloudm-migrate.github.io/documentation/Migration-Project-Guides/TeamstoTeams.html">Migrating Microsoft Teams Private Chats</a> |
